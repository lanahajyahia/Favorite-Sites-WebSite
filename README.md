# Favorite-Sites-WebSite
creating a UI using react for my favorite sites I've ever visted, including description and photos,
with the option to remove, edit and add site

## what I did:
I built a server side which has a REST api to connect with db(mongoo). and then built a client-side that used these api's to fetch and put data into db and display it in the UI.

I used browsify and watchify npm libraries to use axios library which is used to to api calls.
to run my website please use npm install in both files client and server.

My project has two files client and server.
To run the sever, you must type in terminal: npm start.
To run the client, you must run it as a "start with live server" in file index.html (right click) or open the following url with making sure you saved the files with the same path name (http://127.0.0.1:5500/mySitesWeb/client/index.html)

if the browers gives an error to use axios, you must run: npm run watch in terminal.
